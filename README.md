# MYSQL-DATA_CLEANING
Hello Everyone !
 l'm excited to share that l've successfully completed Mysql Project using the 📂 Layoffs dataset . In this project , I worked with real - world workforce data to analyze layoff trends and gain valuable insights.

Key Highlights of My Project :
 ✅ Created Schema: Designed the world_layoffs schema for structured data storage.
 ✅ Data Cleaning:
 🔹 Removed Duplicates: Used DISTINCT and ROW_NUMBER() with CTEs to eliminate duplicate records.
 🔹 Standardized Data: Applied TRIM() to clean extra spaces, converted text to lowercase/uppercase for consistency, and formatted dates correctly.
 🔹 Handled Null & Blank Values: Used COALESCE() to replace NULLs with meaningful values and applied CASE WHEN for better data handling.
 🔹 Dropped Unnecessary Columns: Removed redundant columns to optimize query performance and improve data usability.
 ✅ SQL Operations Used: SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, CREATE, CTE, TRIM, DISTINCT, and various aggregate functions.

 🔍 Next Steps: I plan to Analyze using this data for Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) 💻 .
